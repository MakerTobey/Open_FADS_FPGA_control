# Open FPGA control sub-project for Fluorescence Activated (Microfluidic) Droplet Sorting (FADS)

Repository for the development ... *high-throughput droplet microfluidic* biological assays.
... RedPitaya FPGA, Python, SiPM ...

The aim is to create a prototype that is based on *connectable*, *open*, modern and *low-cost* components (RasberriPi, Adrunio, 3D printing, on-board components, open or at least accessible design software and operation software - python). This is an open collaborative project currently advanced by Nicolas Peschke; *your participation* (comments, inputs, contributions, issues) are explicitly welcome!
